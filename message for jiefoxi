Hello,
Github has removed private messaging, so I hope I maange to get your attention this way.
A few years ago, I hired you on Elance, you were brilliant!
I want to hire you again! BUT Elance have now become UPwork and they are rubbish.
I'd love to hire you for a task again — relating to Javascript again.

Regards
ProjectWine
